                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koala, (Phascolarctos cinereus), tree-dwelling marsupial of coastal eastern and southern Australia 
                    classified in the family Phascolarctidae (suborder Vombatiformes).
                    The koala is about 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 inches) long and weighs up to 14 kg (31 pounds) in the 
                    southern part of its range (Victoria and South Australia) but only about half that in subtropical 
                    Queensland to the north. Virtually tailless, the body is stout and gray, with a pale yellow or 
                    cream-coloured chest and mottling on the rump. The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, 
                    small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears. The feet are strong and clawed; the two inner digits of the 
                    front feet and the innermost digit of the hind feet are opposable for grasping. Because of the 
                    animal’s superficial resemblance to a small bear, the koala is sometimes called, albeit erroneously, 
                    the koala bear.</p>
                    
                    <p>The koala feeds very selectively on the leaves of certain eucalyptus trees. Generally solitary, 
                        individuals move within a home range of more than a dozen trees, one of which is favoured over
                         the others. If koalas become too numerous in a restricted area, they defoliate preferred food 
                         trees and, unable to subsist on even closely related species, decline rapidly. To aid in 
                         digesting as much as 1.3 kg (3 pounds) of leaves daily, the koala has an intestinal pouch (cecum) 
                         about 2 metres (7 feet) long, where symbiotic bacteria degrade the tannins and other toxic and 
                         complex substances abundant in eucalyptus. This diet is relatively poor in nutrients and provides 
                         the koala little spare energy, so the animal spends long hours simply sitting or sleeping in tree 
                         forks, exposed to the elements but insulated by thick fur. Although placid most of the time, 
                         koalas produce loud, hollow grunts.</p>

                    <p>The koala is the only member of the family Phascolarctidae. Unlike those of other arboreal 
                        marsupials, its pouch opens rearward. Births are single, occurring after a gestation of 34 to 
                        36 days. The youngster (called a joey) first puts its head out of the pouch at about five months 
                        of age. For up to six weeks it is weaned on a soupy predigested eucalyptus called pap that is 
                        lapped directly from the mother’s anus. Pap is derived from the cecum. After weaning, the joey 
                        emerges completely from the pouch and clings to the mother’s back until it is nearly a year old. 
                        A koala can live to about 15 years of age in the wild, somewhat longer in captivity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Studies suggest that there are five distinct populations of koalas, which began to diverge from 
                        one another sometime between 300,000 and 430,000 years ago. Formerly killed in huge numbers for 
                        their fur, especially during the 1920s and ’30s, koalas dwindled in number from several million 
                        to a few hundred thousand, which substantially reduced the species’s genetic diversity and that 
                        of four of the five individual populations, making the species susceptible to inbreeding. In the 
                        southern part of their range, koalas became practically extinct, except for a single genetically 
                        diverse population in Gippsland, Victoria. Some were translocated onto small offshore islands, 
                        especially Phillip Island, where they did so well that these koalas were used to restock much of 
                        the original range in Victoria and southern New South Wales. During the same period, some koalas
                        were also introduced to Kangaroo Island, and later (during the 1950s and ’60s) additional animals 
                        were introduced to several other coastal habitats in South Australia. Though once again widespread, 
                        koala populations and subpopulations are now scattered and separated by urban areas and farmland,
                        which makes them locally vulnerable to extinction. Another problem is the infection of many 
                        populations with Chlamydia, which makes the females infertile.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has listed the koala 
                        as a vulnerable species since 2016. The species decreased in number by nearly 28 percent between the 
                        years 1984 and 2012, largely because of habitat loss and fragmentation, which made the animal more 
                        susceptible to vehicle strikes and predation by dogs. Devastating drought and bushfires during the 
                        late 2010s also contributed to the decline in the number of koalas, reducing the total by an 
                        additional 30 percent between 2018 and 2021. As temperatures increase and the drying effects of 
                        climate change become more pronounced in Australia, wildlife officials expect that the number of 
                        koalas will decline further in the coming decades.</p>

                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>Giant panda, (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), bear with striking black-and-white coloration inhabiting bamboo 
                    forests in the mountains of central China. Its coloration, combined with a bulky body and round face, 
                    gives it a captivating appearance that has endeared it to people worldwide. According to the IUCN Red 
                    List of Threatened Species, fewer than 1,900 pandas are thought to remain in the wild.</p>

                    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) inhabits bamboo forests in the mountains of central China.
                        Large males may attain 1.8 metres (6 feet) in length and weigh more than 100 kg (220 pounds); 
                        females are usually smaller. Round black ears and black eye patches stand out against a white face 
                        and neck. Black limbs, tail, legs, and shoulders contrast with the white torso. The rear paws point 
                        inward, which gives pandas a waddling gait. Pandas can easily stand on their hind legs and are 
                        commonly observed somersaulting, rolling, and dust-bathing. Although somewhat awkward as climbers, 
                        pandas readily ascend trees and, on the basis of their resemblance to bears, are probably capable 
                        of swimming. An unusual anatomic characteristic is an enlarged wrist bone that functions somewhat 
                        like a thumb, enabling pandas to handle food with considerable dexterity.</p>
   
                    <p>As much as 90–98 percent of the panda’s diet consists of the leaves, shoots, and stems of bamboo, 
                        a large grass available year-round in much of China’s forested regions. Despite adaptations in 
                        the forepaws, teeth, and jaws for bamboo consumption, the giant panda has retained the digestive 
                        system of its carnivore ancestry and is therefore unable to digest cellulose, a main constituent 
                        of bamboo. Pandas solve this problem by rapidly passing prodigious quantities of the grass 
                        through their digestive tracts on a daily basis. As much as 16 out of every 24 hours is spent 
                        feeding, and elimination of wastes occurs up to 50 times per day. Fossilized dental remains 
                        indicate that the giant panda committed to bamboo as its principal food source at least three 
                        million years ago. Although unable to capture prey, pandas retain a taste for meat, which is used 
                        as bait to capture them for radio collaring and has made them pests in human camps on occasion. 
                        The species cannot naturally survive outside bamboo forests, though in captivity they have been 
                        maintained on cereals, milk, and garden fruits and vegetables. Bamboo is the healthier diet for 
                        captive pandas.</p>

                    <p>The giant panda’s solitary nature is underscored by its reliance on its sense of smell (olfaction). 
                        Each animal confines its activities to a range of about 4 to 6 square km (1.5 to 2.3 square miles), 
                        but these home ranges often overlap substantially. Under this arrangement scent functions in 
                        regulating contact between individuals. A large scent gland located just below the tail and 
                        surrounding the anus is used to leave olfactory messages for other pandas. The gland is rubbed 
                        against trees, rocks, and clumps of grass, with scent conveying information on identity, sex, and 
                        possibly social status of the marking individual. Chemical analysis of marks is consistent with a 
                        difference in function for males and females. Males appear to use scent to identify the areas where 
                        they live, whereas females primarily use it for signaling estrus. Except for the mothers’ care of 
                        infants, the only social activity of pandas takes place during females’ estrus, which occurs 
                        annually during the spring and lasts one to three days. A spring mating season (March–May) and a 
                        fall birth season (August–September) are seen in both wild and captive populations. Males appear to 
                        locate females first by scent and ultimately by vocalizations. Assemblages of one to five males per 
                        female have been recorded. At this time males may become highly aggressive as they compete for the 
                        opportunity to mate.</p>

                    <p>Like bears, giant pandas undergo a delay in implantation of the fertilized ovum into the wall of 
                        the uterus, a period of two to three months after mating. Hormone levels in females’ urine 
                        indicate that the period of embryonic/fetal growth and development lasts only about two months. 
                        Altogether, gestation averages 135 days (with a range of 90–184 days), but, because of the short 
                        growth phase, a term fetus weighs only about 112 grams (4 ounces) on average. Relative to the 
                        mother, giant pandas produce the smallest offspring of any placental mammal (about 1/800 of the 
                        mother’s weight). For the first two to three weeks of life, the mother uses her forepaws and her 
                        thumblike wrist bones to cuddle and position the infant against herself in a rather 
                        uncarnivore-like and almost human fashion. Nearly half of the 133 captive births recorded before 
                        1998 were of twins, but panda mothers are typically unable to care for more than one infant. 
                        Reasons for the extremely small size of the offspring and the frequent production of twins are 
                        not understood, but both are traits shared with bears.</p>                    
                    
                    <p>The newborn panda is blind and covered with only a thin all-white coat. It is virtually helpless, 
                        being able only to suckle and vocalize. It depends on its mother for warmth, nourishment, 
                        positioning at the breast, and stimulating the passage of wastes. Development is slow during the 
                        early months. Eyes begin to open at about 45 days, and the first wobbly steps are taken at 75–80 
                        days. Its helpless state mandates birth in a den, an environment in which it lives for the first 
                        100–120 days of life. By about 14 months, at which age the milk teeth have erupted, the infant 
                        readily consumes bamboo, and at 18–24 months weaning from the mother takes place. Separation from 
                        the mother must occur before a female can undertake the production of her next litter. Captive 
                        pandas may live beyond 30 years in captivity, but life span in the wild is estimated at about 
                        20 years.</p>

                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of 
                    equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western 
                    gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, 
                    from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans 
                    after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>

                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights 
                        between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to 
                        live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from 
                        the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to 
                        live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>
                    
                    <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their 
                        range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The 
                        mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging 
                        in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests 
                        and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central 
                        West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
                        near its border with Rwanda.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both 
                        species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as 
                        Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. 
                        There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which 
                        threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas 
                        where they live.</p>
                    
                     <p>A gorilla's day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ 
                        between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, 
                        and shoots, while fruit makes up a very small part of their diets. Mountain gorilla food is 
                        widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another. Their 
                        home ranges vary from 3 to 15 km2 (1.2 to 5.8 sq mi), and their movements range around 
                        500 m (0.31 mi) or less on an average day. Despite eating a few species in each habitat, 
                        mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats.</p>

                        <p>Eastern lowland gorillas have more diverse diets, which vary seasonally. Leaves and pith are 
                            commonly eaten, but fruits can make up as much as 25% of their diets. Since fruit is less 
                            available, lowland gorillas must travel farther each day, and their home ranges vary from 2.7 
                            to 6.5 km2 (1.0 to 2.5 sq mi), with day ranges 154–2,280 m (0.096–1.417 mi). Eastern lowland 
                            gorillas will also eat insects, preferably ants. Western lowland gorillas depend on fruits 
                            more than the others and they are more dispersed across their range. They travel even 
                            farther than the other gorilla subspecies, at 1,105 m (0.687 mi) per day on average, and have 
                            larger home ranges of 7–14 km2 (2.7–5.4 sq mi). Western lowland gorillas have less access 
                            to terrestrial herbs, although they can access aquatic herbs in some areas. Termites and ants 
                            are also eaten.</p>
                        
                        <p>Gorillas rarely drink water "because they consume succulent vegetation that is comprised of 
                            almost half water as well as morning dew", although both mountain and lowland gorillas 
                            have been observed drinking.</p>

                   <p>Gorillas live in groups called troops. Troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback, with 
                    a harem of multiple adult females and their offspring. However, multiple-male troops also 
                    exist. A silverback is typically more than 12 years of age, and is named for the distinctive patch 
                    of silver hair on his back, which comes with maturity. Silverbacks have large canine teeth that also 
                    come with maturity. Both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups. For mountain 
                    gorillas, females disperse from their natal troops more than males. Mountain gorillas and 
                    western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groups.</p>

                    <p>Mature males also tend to leave their groups and establish their own troops by attracting emigrating 
                        females. However, male mountain gorillas sometimes stay in their natal troops and become subordinate 
                        to the silverback. If the silverback dies, these males may be able to become dominant or mate with 
                        the females. This behaviour has not been observed in eastern lowland gorillas. In a single male group, 
                        when the silverback dies, the females and their offspring disperse and find a new troop. 
                        Without a silverback to protect them, the infants will likely fall victim to infanticide. Joining a new 
                        group is likely to be a tactic against this. However, while gorilla troops usually disband 
                        after the silverback dies, female eastern lowlands gorillas and their offspring have been recorded 
                        staying together until a new silverback transfers into the group. This likely serves as protection from 
                        leopards.</p>

                    <p>The silverback is the centre of the troop's attention, making all the decisions, mediating 
                        conflicts, determining the movements of the group, leading the others to feeding sites, and 
                        taking responsibility for the safety and well-being of the troop. Younger males subordinate to 
                        the silverback, known as blackbacks, may serve as backup protection. Blackbacks are aged between 
                        8 and 12 years and lack the silver back hair. The bond that a silverback has with his females 
                        forms the core of gorilla social life. Bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying 
                        close together. Females form strong relationships with males to gain mating opportunities 
                        and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males. However, aggressive behaviours 
                        between males and females do occur, but rarely lead to serious injury. Relationships between 
                        females may vary. Maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other 
                        and associate closely. Otherwise, females have few friendly encounters and commonly act 
                        aggressively towards each other.</p>
                    
                    <p>Females may fight for social access to males and a male may intervene. Male gorillas have weak 
                        social bonds, particularly in multiple-male groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong 
                        competition for mates. Males in all-male groups, though, tend to have friendly interactions and 
                        socialise through play, grooming, and staying together, and occasionally they even engage in 
                        homosexual interactions. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two mountain 
                        gorilla groups meet the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their 
                        canines to cause deep, gaping injuries.</p>
                   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

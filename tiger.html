                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>Tiger, (Panthera tigris), largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion 
                    (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity; it is a famous apex predator (meaning without a natural 
                    predator or enemy). The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian 
                    Far East through parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of 
                    Sumatra. The Siberian, or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the largest, measuring up to 4 metres 
                    (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or Bengal, tiger 
                    (P. tigris tigris) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. 
                    Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 
                    2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from 
                    the south are smaller than those of the north.</p>

                    <p>The Indo-Chinese (P. tigris corbetti), and Sumatran (P. tigris sumatrae) tigers are bright reddish 
                        tan, beautifully marked with dark, almost black, vertical stripes. The underparts, the inner 
                        sides of the limbs, the cheeks, and a large spot over each eye are whitish. The rare Siberian 
                        tiger has longer, softer, and paler fur. White tigers, not all of them true albinos, have occurred 
                        from time to time, almost all of them in India (see also albinism). Black tigers have been reported 
                        less frequently from the dense forests of Myanmar (Burma), Bangladesh, and eastern India. The tiger
                        has no mane, but in old males the hair on the cheeks is rather long and spreading. Although most 
                        classifications separate the species into six subspecies, some merge subspecies or suggest that two 
                        tiger species exist, P. tigris on the mainland of Asia and P. sondaica of Java, Bali, and Sumatra.</p>
     
                    <p>The tiger has adapted to a great variety of environments, from the Siberian taiga, where nights can 
                        be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans, where the temperatures 
                        reach more than 40 °C (104 °F). Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and 
                        are at home in habitats ranging from dry grassland to rainforest. Grasslands, mixed 
                        grassland-forests, and deciduous rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population 
                        densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species. Having evolved in the 
                        temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of heat than other 
                        large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under 
                        stress it may climb trees.</p>
                    

                    <p>The tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large 
                        prey such as deer (sambar, chital, and swamp deer) and wild pigs. A special liking for porcupines, 
                        despite the danger of injury from their quills, is an exception. Healthy large mammals are generally 
                        avoided, although there have been recorded instances of the tiger’s having attacked elephants and 
                        adult water buffalo. Cattle are occasionally taken from human habitations, and some tigers can thrive 
                        on domestic livestock. After making a kill and consuming what it can, it makes a deliberate attempt 
                        to hide the carcass from vultures and other scavengers so that another meal can be obtained. Tigers 
                        are not averse to commandeering a kill from other tigers or leopards, and they sometimes eat carrion. 
                        Skill in killing and obtaining prey is only partly instinctive, maternal training being essential for 
                        proficiency. For this reason, tigers raised in captivity would not fare well if released into the wild. 
                        As the top predator throughout its range, the tiger plays a major role in controlling not only its 
                        prey population but that of other predators such as the leopard, dhole (Asiatic wild dog), and clouded 
                        leopard. No trait of the tiger has fascinated humans more than man eating. A number of reasons account 
                        for this—disability caused by age or injury, paucity of prey, acquisition of the habit from the mother, 
                        or defense of cubs or kill. With the reduction in the number of tigers, the occurrence of man-eating 
                        tigers has become rare except in the Sundarbans, the northeast Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and 
                        neighbouring Nepal in and around Royal Chitwan National Park.</p>

                    <p>As solitary animals, tigers (especially males) establish and maintain their own territories, the 
                        size and nature of which vary with the number and distribution of prey, the presence of other 
                        tigers in the area, the nature of the terrain, the availability of water, and individual 
                        characteristics. Spacing between individuals and maintenance of territories are achieved through 
                        vocalization, scrapings on the ground, claw marking of trees, fecal deposits, scent deposited by 
                        the rubbing of facial glands, and spraying of urine mixed with scent secreted from the anal 
                        glands. The solitary nature of the species also helps minimize territorial conflict. Nonetheless,
                         confrontations do occur, sometimes resulting in injury and even death.</p>

                    <p>Next to the elephant and the lion, no wild animal is so frequently portrayed in Asian art and lore. 
                        The persistent practices of using tiger parts as talismans, tonics, or medicine, despite all 
                        scientific evidence contrary to their efficacy, are manifestations of beliefs that emanate from the 
                        aura of the tiger and the awe that it has inspired for millennia. Certain animist communities still
                        worship the tiger. Every 12th year of the Chinese calendar is the year of the tiger, and children 
                        born in it are considered especially lucky and powerful. In Hindu mythology the tiger is the vahana 
                        (“vehicle”) of the goddess Durga. Tigers are represented on seals from the ancient Indus 
                        civilization. The greatest of the Gupta emperors of ancient India, Samudra, minted special gold 
                        coins depicting him slaying tigers. Tippu Sultan even vented his frustration at his inability to 
                        defeat the British by ordering a special life-size toy, replete with sound, of a tiger mauling a 
                        British soldier.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, the world’s tiger population was estimated at 100,000, 
                            even though they had been hunted for at least a thousand years. Tigers were prized as trophies 
                            and as a source of skins for expensive coats. They were also killed on the grounds that they 
                            posed a danger to humans. As the century drew to a close, only 5,000 to 7,500 were left in the 
                            wild, and captive tigers may now outnumber wild ones. Since then, the world’s tiger population 
                            has declined to about 3,200 animals. The South China tiger (P. tigris amoyensis) is the most 
                            endangered, with only a few dozen animals remaining. The Malayan subspecies (P. tigris jacksoni), 
                            which was determined to be genetically distinct from the Indo-Chinese subspecies (P. tigris 
                            corbetti) in 2004, is composed of perhaps 500 individuals. The Siberian and Sumatran subspecies 
                            number less than 500 each, and the Indo-Chinese population is estimated at less than 300. Three 
                            subspecies have gone extinct within the past century: the Caspian (P. tigris virgata) of central 
                            Asia, the Javan (P. tigris sondaica), and the Bali (P. tigris balica). Because the tiger is so 
                            closely related to the lion, they can be crossbred in captivity. The offspring of such matings are 
                            called tigons when the male (sire) is a tiger and ligers when the sire is a lion.</p>

                        <p>Serious concern for the declining number of tigers was expressed during the latter half of the 
                            20th century, and gradually all countries in the tiger’s range took measures to protect the 
                            animal, but with varying degrees of success. The tiger is now legally protected throughout its 
                            range, but law enforcement is not universally effective. India, which accounts for half the 
                            world’s tiger population, declared it the national animal and launched Project Tiger in 1973, a 
                            successful program under which selected tiger reserves received special conservation efforts 
                            and status. Nepal, Malaysia, and Indonesia have set up a string of national parks and 
                            sanctuaries where the animal is effectively protected; Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam are 
                            pursuing the same course. China, the only country with three subspecies of tigers, is also 
                            giving special attention to conservation. In Russia, where poaching seriously endangered the 
                            Siberian tiger, concentrated effort and effective patrolling have resulted in a revival of the 
                            subspecies.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>In the 1970s tiger hunting for sport was banned in most countries where tigers lived, and the 
                            trade in tiger skins was outlawed. Nevertheless, tiger skins are still highly valued for display 
                            and for worship, as are claws, teeth, and clavicles for talismans. Skulls, bones, whiskers, 
                            sinews, meat, and blood have long been used by Asians, especially the Chinese, in medicines, 
                            potions, and even wine. These products are presumed to be useful in the treatment of rheumatism, 
                            rat bites, and various other diseases, for the restoration of energy, and as aphrodisiacs; 
                            whiskers are believed to cause intestinal ulcers in one’s enemies. Poaching and the underground 
                            trade in tiger parts continue despite seizures and destruction of the confiscated parts.</p>
                        
                        <p>Although poaching has been responsible for keeping the number of tigers low during the past three 
                            decades, wild tigers would still be threatened even if all poaching ceased. In countries such as 
                            India, the needs of rapidly growing human populations over the last two centuries have reduced 
                            both the quantity and the quality of habitat. Forests and grasslands so favoured by the tiger are 
                            cleared for agriculture. Reduction in prey populations results in greater dependence on livestock 
                            and the consequent retribution from man. Fortunately, the status of the tiger has aroused 
                            widespread empathy, and its cause has received substantial international support. The World Wide 
                            Fund for Nature has been a pioneer and the largest contributor, along with corporate donors and 
                            nongovernmental organizations. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species is 
                            entrusted with the task of controlling illegal trade in tiger derivatives. In addition, 
                            high-ranking officials of 13 countries hosting tiger populations gathered in St. Petersburg, 
                            Russia, in 2010 for the International Forum on Tiger Conservation and agreed to help one another 
                            double overall tiger numbers by 2022.</p>

                    <p>The readiness of a tigress to mate is announced through vocalization and scent production. There is no 
                        fixed breeding season, though the preponderance of mating appears to occur in winter, with striped 
                        cubs being born after a gestation period of more than three months. The normal litter size is two to 
                        four, though up to seven cubs have been recorded. They are born blind, and, even when their eyes open, 
                        opacity prevents clear vision for six to eight weeks. There is thus a long period of weaning, tutelage, 
                        and training during which cub mortality is high, especially if food is scarce. During this time the 
                        offspring must endure long periods of absence by the mother while she is away hunting. Weaker cubs get 
                        less food because of the aggressiveness of their stronger siblings as food is less frequently made 
                        available. The cubs remain with the mother until about the second year, when they are nearly adult and 
                        are able to kill prey for themselves. Male cubs grow more quickly than females and tend to leave their 
                        mother earlier. Though cub infanticide (mainly by males) is known, it is not very unusual to find a male 
                        with a tigress and cubs, even sharing a kill. Such associations, however, do not last long. The tigress 
                        does not breed again until her cubs are independent. The average life span of a tiger in the wild is about 
                        11 years.</p>
